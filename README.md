# Learning about Next.js 15+

By: Luis Salazar.

This project is for learning about Next.js. I will upload a dummy app to test, creat and experiment with different things in Next.js, that is why I will use some technologies as: ***Typescript***, ***ESLint***, ***Tailwind CSS*** and ***App Router***. So, I will include the **Getting Started** default content of the README file, also I plan to include some other content as web pages or links to use in the development of this app. I will use this project mainly to grow my knowledge in Front-end content.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Optional Links

To modify and create CSS components using the **Tailwind CSS** configuration, this link has many hints, tricks and helps to create CSS code: <https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/>
